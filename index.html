<!-- My short bio -->
<p1> My name is Gabrielle Pierce and I am a junior computer science student from Prince George's County, Maryland. I started coding when I was in elementary school at a summer camp at the University of Maryland. I was the youngest in the cohort but quickly fell in love with the field. From there, I was enrolled into a STEM middle and high school where I obtained my Associate's Degree in 2022. It only made sense for me to then attend the #1 producers of black engineers, North Carolina A&T. </p1>
